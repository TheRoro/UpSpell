### Special Characters App

[**UpSpell**](https://upspell.vercel.app/) is a Special Characters Web Application developed in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)/[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) whose main objective is to provide special characters for all those who are learning a language or whose keymap does not have the character they want to type.

We are currently supporting the special characters for this languages:

- [Spanish](https://upspell.vercel.app/es)
- [French](https://upspell.vercel.app/fr)
- [Portuguese](https://upspell.vercel.app/pt)
- [Italian](https://upspell.vercel.app/it)

Feel free to suggest us more language special characters, and if you like the project, don't forget to star it!
